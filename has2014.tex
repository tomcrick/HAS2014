\begin{abstract}
There has been significant interest in the identification and
profiling of insider threats, attracting high-profile policy focus and
strategic research funding from governments and funding bodies.
Recent examples attracting worldwide attention include the cases of
Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden and the US authorities. The challenges
with profiling an individual across a range of activities is that
their data footprint will legitimately vary significantly based on
time and/or location. The insider threat problem is thus a specific
instance of the more general problem of profiling complex
behaviours. In this paper, we discuss our preliminary research models
relating to profiling complex behaviours and present a set of
experiments related to changing roles as viewed through large-scale
social network datasets, such as Twitter. We employ psycholinguistic
metrics in this work, considering changing roles from the standpoint
of a trait-based personality theory.  We also present further
representations, including an alternative psychological theory (not
trait-based), and established techniques for crime modelling,
spatio-temporal and graph/network, to investigate within a wider
reasoning framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The motivation for this preliminary research is a long-standing
interest in determining personality and behaviour from digital data
and especially profiling insider threats, a situation where granted
access is used illegitimately, often in situations where it is known
that actions are scrutinised closely (such as by machine learning
algorithms). How best then to develop a profile of an individual (we
do not consider group behavior in this paper) so that criminal
behavior, which is assumed to be different in some way to normal
operating behaviour, can be detected. The data footprint will vary
significantly based on either time, location or role, as the
individual legitimately passes through their range of activities; for
instance, an operator accessing a computer terminal at one location in
the morning and another in the afternoon. Likewise, the data footprint
will change according to shifting emotional states; for instance, the
same operator working at a single terminal differently on different
days, one day performing the `harder' tasks first, and another day,
the `easier' tasks first. Thus, we have the general problem of
profiling complex behaviours.

From collaborations with several UK police forces and crime prevention
partnerships, we have seen a wide range of data and problems, with the
need to develop models with predictive or classification power,
embedded in decision support systems, namely: gun gangs, terrorism
networks, retail crime gangs, volume crime, fraud and sex offences.
Each problem collected different data, and therefore different
techniques were more appropriate to model the criminal behaviour.

Recent research suggests that it may be possible to identify
personality traits through textual analysis, that is, analysis of the
style and nature of an individuals written expression. A person's
identity or personality is reflected in everything they do, including
website design~\cite{vazire+gosling:2004} and textual communication on
the Internet more generally. The growth of social networking websites
has put an enormous amount of such written expressions into the public
domain for the first time, and investigators have presented frameworks
for forensic treatment of this data~\cite{haggerty-et-al:2012}.
Included in our study, we present an unreported set of experiments
related to changing roles as viewed through Twitter social media data.

Attempts to characterise personality typologies, include McAdams'
intuitively appealing model~\cite{adams:1996} with the three levels of
({\emph{i}}) traits, ({\emph{ii}}) mental concerns and strategies
(intermediate knowing), and ({\emph{iii}}) life story (intimate
level). Gosling~\cite{gosling:2009} describes the trait level as
painting a portrait in broad brushstrokes but which leaves out much of
the finer detail. An example of a trait model is the Big Five or Five
Factors (as used in our study), namely: extraversion, emotional
stability, agreeableness to other people, conscientiousness and
openness to experience~\cite{costa+mccrae:1992,norman:1963}. There are
many ways to be extraverted for instance, and what are these traits
able to tell us about a person's values, beliefs, goals and roles;
these are the next level of knowing someone. Having worked through the
traits and personal concerns of McAdams’ first two levels, you strike
the bedrock of personality -- identity. McAdams describes this third
level as ``{\emph{an inner story of the self that integrates the
reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future to
provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning.}}''

For many operational purposes McAdams' lower level of traits can often
be sufficient, and certainly, because of its extensive use, it
provides a way of comparing research; over the last 50 years the Five
Factor model has become a standard in
psychology~\cite{mairesse-et-al:2007}, developing a large body of
research for comparison.

\section{Geospatial, Network and Modus Operandi Data}\label{geospatial}

Working with burglary data from West Midlands
Police~\cite{oatley+ewart:2003,oatley-et-al:2006a,oatley-et-al:2006b}
in the UK, several new methods were developed, including the composite
of geographical range and network connections as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:geonets}. Each `square' is an offender, associated by
co-defendant (arrested together) links to other offenders. The map for
each offender shows their geographic range of offending. Each offender
also had a list of property stolen against each of their crimes, and
modus operandi (see Table~\ref{tab:burgdwellingsmo}), upon which it
was possible to develop predictive models.

\caption{Burglary from dwelling house -- modus operandi features.}
\label{tab:burgdwellingsmo}
\end{table}

The modus operandi data was routinely gathered by scenes of crime
officers (SOCOs), and contained a range of `styles' of burgling, using
force or craft and so on~\cite{ewart+oatley:2003}.  A crucial
recommendation to West Midlands Police was that the SOCOs would record
richer data that could more adequately distinguish between obviously
different crime locations and perpetrators, in order to infer
behaviours and traits.

% Gang-related crime with Greater Manchester Police received a wide
% range of technologies~\cite{oatley+crick:unpub}. 

Ewart \& Oatley~\cite{ewart+oatley:2003} compared models that used
just spatio-temporal data (including correlated walk analysis) against
modus operandi, and a combination of both. The combined models
performed best. Figure~\ref{fig:offvictrips} shows a geographical plot
with triples of [\emph{offender home address, location, victim home
address}] for a range of crime types, including woundings, murder,
manslaughter, kidnapping and firearms offences. Representing the data
in this way, we are able (as in the previous geographical network) to
see offending characteristics such as criminal range, and
relationships between crime types.

It is clear when looking at crime histories of certain gang members in
Greater Manchester, UK, that they committed specific types of crimes,
for instance it was unlikely for a career burglar to escalate the
severity of their crimes to murder. There were predictors evident of
future crimes: the future gun users often including in their histories
lack of empathy (evidenced by abduction, rape) and failure to accept
responsibility for own actions (aggression against police), and so
on. It was clear there were different `types' of criminal identified
within the data.

Similar type modus operandi and the geographic and temporal data was
available for retail crime gangs in the north-east of
England~\cite{ewart+oatley:2009}. Retail crime is defined as
specifically stealing from retail outlets or shops. We were interested
in the most useful way of characterising a network or gang -- was it
perhaps on the basis of its membership (i.e. its stability, number,
type: family or not) or do gangs differ on the basis of their
geographical range and modi operandi, for instance falling into groups
such a `local', `travelling' or not.  We explored this by analysing
line connectivity and node connectivity over time for particular gangs
and the concepts of fragmentation, density, transitivity and
core/periphery structures (see Borgatti et
al.~\cite{borgatti-et-al:2009}).  Certainly it was intimated from
intelligence that within the data there were specialist and highly
organised gangs, for instance gangs from eastern Europe specialising
in purse theft, or a Malaysian gang targeting cheque fraud, or others
favouring mobile phone theft.

\section{Personality Theories}\label{personality}

\subsection{Detection (covertly) of personality type through game playing}\label{detectiongp}

A set rules of nine rules, representing the nine types of the
Enneagram personality typolology~\cite{newgent-et-al:2004}, was embedded in a game with various
`states' through which a user could navigate~\cite{oatleymsc:1996}; see
Figure~\ref{fig:sneakarch}. States in an `everyday life game' might
include: `{\emph{Getting ready for work}}', `{\emph{Taking an evening meal}}', `{\emph{Walking
through a park}}' and so on. States are linked according to real life,
so you can pass from `{\emph{Taking breakfast}}' to `{\emph{Travelling to work}}', but
not from the former to `{\emph{Taking an evening meal}}'. Questions are asked
of the user at each `state', the answers to which are known to
indicate evidence of a certain personality type. For instance, rules
for Types 2 and 5 are presented in Listings~\ref{lst:rule1} and
\ref{lst:rule2}. Importantly, the player is unaware that the game is
slowly determining their personality type (hence the name
SNEAK). SNEAK  actively searches for the nearest useful `states'
that can quickly lead to a classification, and plots a course
towards them. As each state follows coherently from the previous,
SNEAK presents the new states to the player, and the player is unaware
of the unfolding analysis.

This system was a rapidly developed prototype, to investigate the
extent of domain knowledge required to achieve a realistic
classification. Commenting on the system, an experienced Enneagram
practitioner said of Rule 1 that it was representative of the type but
that ``{\emph{...it could also possibly be a type2Giver. `sensingPerfection' is
too high a concept, probably something that the person is not normally
conscious of.}}'', and of Rule 5, that it was again representative,
``{\emph{but it is generally an easily recognisable type anyway, at least, by
themselves.}}''

The rules were simple, the states were contrived and of a
limited number, in order that every response from every type was able
to be coded. This is a long way from automatically diagnosing
someone's personality type through user interaction. Indeed, even for a
human, administering a personality interview is notoriously
difficult; for instance, the standard PCL-R assessment
procedure for psychopathy~\cite{hare:2003} requires a semi-structured interview and a
review of available file and collateral information. The purposes of
the interview include providing a sample of the individual's
interpersonal style, and allowing the user to compare and evaluate the
consistency of statements and responses, both within the interview and
between the interview and the collateral/file
information~\cite{hare:2003}.  Plutchick and
Conte~\cite{plutchick+conte:1989} confirm this difficulty: ``{\emph{A simple change in
test instructions e.g. `how do you feel now?' vs. `how do you usually
feel?' generally changes a mood measure into a personality trait
measure.}}''. Without significant structure it is hard to know what is being
assessed.

\subsection{Detection of personality traits through textual analysis
  of social network data}\label{detection}

Advances in psychology research have suggested it may be
possible to classify personality through usage of textual analysis of
social networking sites rather than the traditional approaches such as
interviews or survey self-completion. Studies in the USA have
suggested certain key words and phrases can signal underlying
tendencies and that this can form the basis of identifying certain
aspects of personality~\cite{woodworth-et-al:2012}. Extrapolating
forward suggests that by investigation of an individual's online
comments it maybe possible to identify individuals personality
traits. Initial evidence in support of this hypothesis was
demonstrated in 2012 by a study which analysed Twitter data for
signs of psychotic behaviour in respondents~\cite{sumner-et-al:2012}.

There have been many studies relating to personality and language
using the Five Factor model of
personality~\cite{pennebaker+king:1999,oberlander+gill:2004,oberlander+gill:2006,iacobelli-et-al:2011}.
However, the Five Factor model has known
limits~\cite{eysenck:1992,paunonen+jackson:2000,block:2010}: it has
been criticised for its limited scope, methodology and the absence of
an underlying theory, and attempts to replicate the Five Factor model
in other countries with local dictionaries have succeeded in some
countries but not in
others~\cite{szirmak+deraad:1994,defruyt-et-al:2004}. Additionally,
while Costa and McCrae~\cite{costa+mccrae:1992} claim that their Five
Factor model ``represents basic dimensions of personality'',
psychologists have identified important trait models, for instance
Cattell's 16 Personality Factors~\cite{cattell:1946} and Eysenck's
biologically based theory~\cite{eysenck:1947}. However, as discussed
previously, this model has a significant body of research, which
provides useful context for studies.

We have used a top-down dictionary
approach~\cite{oberlander+gill:2006}, as opposed to a bottom-up
method, such as collection of words and n-grams. We use two standard
psycholinguistic dictionaries: LIWC~\footnote{Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count.  Pennebaker and King~\cite{pennebaker+king:1999} discuss
the individual differences in linguistic styles, and developed the
LIWC tool to try and measure these. Their text analysis software
calculates the degree to which people use different categories of
word, determining the degree any text uses positive or negative
emotions, self-references, causal words, and 70 other language
dimensions.} and MRC~\footnote{The MRC Psycholinguistic Database is a
machine-usable dictionary containing 150,837 words with up to 26
linguistic and psycholinguistic attributes for each -- psychological
measures are recorded for only about 2500 words. This data was
empirically derived, which differs from the human judgment of
psychological categories that created the LIWC.}, and the equations
based upon these features, for the Five Factors, based upon the work
of Mairesse et al.~\cite{mairesse-et-al:2007}. MRC category
{\texttt{K\_F\_NSAMP}} is the Kucera-Francis number of samples (from
the Brown Corpus analysis), LIWC categories {\texttt{UNIQUE}},
{\texttt{ABBREVIATIONS}} and {\texttt{PRONOUN}} are the number of unique
words, abbreviations and pronouns respectively, and {\texttt{HEARING}}
is a count of words such as `heard', `listen', `sound'. An example
equation is presented in Listing~\ref{lst:mrcliwc}.

%%% Insert Listing 3 here

\end{lstlisting}

The data that we have used for this study is from Twitter, and specifically looks at a person's
retweet count. This tag is an unofficial way to provide
attribution to the original publisher. If a person wishes to share a tweet
from someone else (irrespective of whether they agree or disagree with
it), it is possible to re-tweet it and share it on their own Twitter
timeline. The retweet count provides the number of times
that the tweet has been re-tweeted.

Therefore, a retweet count of zero means the tweet is authored by the
user, whereas a value greater than zero means that someone else
authored the tweet, although the user has shared the content. A count
of zero indicates the user's own words and sentiments, a count greater
than zero indicates other's words. Of course we can make further
categories, for instance a count of 1 will indicate people being
directly followed, and much larger counts will indicate very popular
sentiments, and so on. However for this study, we consider only these
two categories. In this way, for a single user, we have two different
chunks of text, aggregated self-authored tweets and aggregated
followed tweets. We perform our Five Factor analysis on these, giving
two sets of Five Factor results for each user. In future work we will
use multi-dimensional scaling to work out an algorithmic difference
between users; however for this study we have selected Chernoff
faces~\cite{chernoff:1973} for the visual representation. The Five
Factors are displayed as five features on a stylised
face. Figure~\ref{fig:chernoff} shows the Chernoff face representation
of the Five Factors (using the R language with the {\emph{aplpack}}
library). A specific facial feature represents each one of the
factors. Additionally the height of face (extraversion) has an
additional impact also on the colour of the face, the width of eyes
influences the eye colour, the width of hair affects the colour of the
hair, and the width of nose effects the colour of nose.

\section{Conclusions}
While we have to be cautious about what we deduce in relation to
criminal profiling~\cite{alison-et-al:2002,snook-et-al:2008}, there is
no doubt it is possible to determine certain traits of operational
value from structured analysis of data from crime investigations. This
will be equally true of data aggregated from other sources. Different
data lends itself to different forms of analysis. In some
circumstances traits and affects can be revealed, in others perhaps
even the beliefs, opinions, or notions of identity (McAdams' top and
middle levels).

This paper has presented a wide range of operational data and
modelling techniques.  These have differed with respect to the degree
of knowledge inherent in the data itself, the sophistication of the
modelling technique and the difficulty of the operational inference.
The geospatial and network data (and their standard modelling
techniques) are sufficient to characterise certain features of
operational usefulness (matching crimes in an area, identifying
possible accomplices, determining local versus travelling criminals),
but barely reaching McAdams' trait level.  Modus operandi data
contains greater potential for psychological modelling, for instance
whether someone is careful, risk averse, capable of violence,
possessing a degree of craft, all indicating traits.  The rule-based
personality game illustrated the need for a heavily indexed and
tightly constrained knowledge to detect personality features best
described as McAdams' middle and even highest level.  Finally the
textual data from Twitter was sufficient to apply psycholinguistic
techniques (although we are not able in this paper to consider the
limitations of the approach), revealing personality trait knowledge
(McAdams' lowest level). The technique (and future use of
multi-dimensional scaling) shows how different high level profiles for
an individual can be computed and visualised.
 
It is hoped that with additional knowledge sources, and solutions from
the converging fields of psychology and personality, mindfulness and
psychoanalysis, with computer-based models (for instance, using
belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents and life-logging) that this field
will develop significantly in the future.
